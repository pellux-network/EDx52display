### Changed

### Fixed

### Known Bugs
- Selecting a system from the left-side external panel results in either 0 or 16 jumps remaining being displayed. This is unfortunately a bug with ED's journaling where it's actually displaying those number as jumps remaining so this will require a fix on Frontier's end
