# EDx52display

Seamlessly reads Elite Dangerous journal data and presents real-time system, planet, cargo, and other information on your Saitek/Logitech X52 Pro Multi-Function Display. Updated and Maintained.

> **INFO:** *This software only works with the Saitek/Logitech X52 Pro. The standard X52 HOTAS does not support third-party software for the MFD.*

â€»*Development is ongoing. See the [changelog](https://github.com/pellux-network/EDx52display/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details on recent fixes and features.*

## Getting Started

Simply download the latest release zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/pellux-network/EDx52display/releases/latest) page. Unzip it into a location of your choosing such as `C:\Games\`. If you haven't modified Elite Dangerous' journal path and don't want to disable any pages, simply run the included `.exe` and your MFD should immediately begin loading. 

If your journal file location is different than the default or you wish to disable any pages, check the [Configuration](link) page on the [Wiki](https://github.com/pellux-network/EDx52display/wiki)

> **INFO:** *It is recommended to run a tool that uploads data to the Elite Dangerous Data Network, such as [ED Market Connector](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector). Doing this will ensure that any new discoveries can be shown on the display.*
